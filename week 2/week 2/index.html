     <h1> Welcome to Eliana Sweet's site </h1>
     <p> Something that I want to learn more of is dolphins since
       they are one of my favorite animals. Some fun facts about dolphins
       is that they have 72-104 teeth! They also do not use their teeth to chew,
       they use them to grab food and swallow the food whole. Dolphins also
       get all their water from the fish they eat, they don't directly drink
       water. Dolphins are some of the most intelligent mammals on our planet.
       Dolphins communicate through chirps and whistles, they are also very
       playful and do jumps and acrobatic spins in the air.</p>
